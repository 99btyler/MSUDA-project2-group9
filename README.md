MSU Data Analytics Project 2, Group 9

# Executive Summary
### Part 1: Extract and Transform
From the .xlsx files, we create DataFrames and then .csv files
* [Extract and Transform](submission/part1_extract-transform.ipynb) which puts data in [csv-files](submission/resources/output/csv-files)
### Part 2: Database Design and Load
We create an ERD. Then, in pgAdmin4, we create a database and tables of imported data from the .csv files
* [ERD](submission/part2.1_ERD.png) which comes with the [ERD code](submission/part2.4_ERD-code.txt) and [ERD PostgreSQL](submission/part2.5_ERD-PostgreSQL.txt)
* [Schema](submission/part2.3_schema.sql) which comes with the [pgAdmin4 Steps](submission/part2.2_pgAdmin4-steps.pdf)
### Part 3: Analysis
First, we query the database. Then, using SQLAlchemy, we create visualizations by doing an exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* [Queries](submission/part3.1_queries.sql)
* [EDA](submission/part3.2_EDA.ipynb) which comes with [figs](submission/resources/output/figs)
### Part 4: Writeup
We summarize our purpose, process, and results
* [Writeup](submission/part4.1_writeup.pdf)
